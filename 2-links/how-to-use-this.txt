files.html:
    In the head tag there is a link tag. The link tag will be talked about in another file but for this file we use it
    to call a CSS file. CSS isn't really an HTML thing so it won't be talked about in this repository.

    html > head > link
        This part will explain how the link tag works in this file. The rel="stylesheet" argument is saying this link is
        for a CSS file. The href="your../file../name/" is the link to your CSS file that will change your HTML.

    html > head > script
        The script tag is for linking JS. The src="your../file../name/" is the link to you JS that will interact with
        the console.


websites.html
    In the body tag there is a tag called a that is used to link a file or website.

    html > body > a
        The a tag has an argument which is href which links to either a file or website.
